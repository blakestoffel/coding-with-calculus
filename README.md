A compilation of my contributions to CSBP4830 Coding With Calculus 

https://github.com/blakestoffel/coding-with-calculus.git

## Overview:

This class examined the fundamentals of calculus following primarily the first six chapters of Calculus in Context. From Euler's method through differential equations, modeling, Neuton's Method, Riemann Sums, and integration. What follows is a compilation of my assignments examining calculus through coding projects in Python (with some hand drawn and completed problem sets as well). This repository will have all of the homework Jupyter notebooks I completed in both .ipnyb and .pdf, however the most representative example of my work is Week 5/6. This week modelled Lotka-Voltera Equation using Rabbit and Fox populations, then expanded into logistics equations modeling fermentation as an increasing complex set of differential equations. Finally the project explored Newton's Cooling principles. I have kept this as a top level folder with the rest of the homework in lower level folders.


## Contributions

Beyond these homework assignments, my contribution to the class included being an active participant in Office Hours and contributions to Piazza. 

## Piazza 

I stay active on piazza, happy to help other students with their questions such as:
https://piazza.com/class/lzmw310nhiy5rz/post/60_f2 helping with code questions. 
https://piazza.com/class/lzmw310nhiy5rz/post/58_f6

Willing to ask the "dumb" questions such as asking for help with the anti-derivative homework here https://piazza.com/class/lzmw310nhiy5rz/post/117_f2

I was able to provide some value teaching how to annotate graphs in this week by sharing my code:

Often I will post a note or two I found useful from office hours:

And occasionally just share fun videos or extra info I think other students and the instructor would find interesting such as these examples:
